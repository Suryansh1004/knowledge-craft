// This file will be deleted and replaced by next.config.js
// The build system should handle the deletion if a new file with a different name is created.
// If explicit deletion is needed, a separate step would be required, but typically creating next.config.js
// and removing next.config.ts from the project effectively renames it.
// For the purpose of this XML, we'll provide the content for the new file.
// The user's system should ensure next.config.ts is removed or ignored.
